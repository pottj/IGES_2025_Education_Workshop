# Day 2 (01/09/2025)

## Opening Session

- slido questionaires
- IGES action plan for LLM and IGES

## Session 1: Williams Awards (9am - 10am)

### Yixin Zhang: Biological Group-Guided Mediation Analysis (abstract 97)

- BMI on HbA1c via metabolites
- Classic approach: test all metabolites
- Here: group metabolites to increase power & biological interpretation
- Framingham Heart Study data: BMI at exam 1, metabolites at exam 2, HbA1c at exam 3 to prevent inverse causation

### Alec McKinlay: Influence of Heritable Covariates on Genetic Studies of the Human Gut Microbiome (abstract 18) 

- ... and Consequences for downstream MR
- lack of replication of microbiome QTL & complex mechanisms of association
- example about lactose: if you are intolerant, because _LCT_ is not working, but continue to drink milk, your microbiome will start digesting lactose for you! environmental effect
- Flemish Gut Flora Project (FGFP)
- conclusion: do not do MR with microbiome as exposure (maybe as an outcome -> do always reverse MR) 

### Jakob Woerner: Polygenic Scores in Proteomic Risk Prediction (abstract 43) 

- UKB proteomics 2027 release for all participants & up to 5000 proteins (pharma release 2026)
- prevalent cases (before baseline), incident cases (after baseline), controls
- train set: prevalent + controls, test set: incident + controls
- in general: protein risk scores perform better than the simple polygenetic risk scores

### Fiona Pantrin: Characterisation of Diverse Global Ancestries Within Participants of the UK Biobank (abstract 58) 

- Most researcher focus on "White British" participants of the UKB - the rest is understudied
- get ancestry label for each individual
- try fine-scale ancestry group by IBD
- outlier: high IBD - Ashkenazi Jewish reference

## Session 2: Neel Awards (10.20am - 11:50am)

## Session 3: Diverstiy (1:25pm - 2:55pm)

## Poster Session 1 (2:55pm - 4:15pm)

## Session 4: Statistical Modeling (4:15pm - 5:45pm)
