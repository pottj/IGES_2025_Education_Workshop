# IGES day 3, Tuesday 02/09/2025, Cologne, GER

## Session 5: Machine Learning (8.30am - 10.00am)

### Best Paper 2024

- JAM: joint analysis of marginal summary statistics
- JAM and MR and TWAS - read [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33404048/)
- works very similar to MVMR-IVW 
- mJAM: hierachical joint analysis of margianl summary statistics - multipopulation fine mapping ([paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38606643/))
- other paper: high dimensional instrumental analysis of omics data ([paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38887957/))

### Han Chen: IBD Mapping Identifies Associations for Brain Imaging Phenotypes (abstract 107) 

- Fast IBD mapping test ([FiMAP](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1011057))
- uses linear mixed model, SNP level resolution

### Wei Pan: Deep Learning Based Multivariable Instrumental Variable Regression for Nonlinear TWAS (abstract 135) 

- Latex presentation - too fast for me to understand the model

### Andrey Ziyatdinov: Robust Rare Variant Association Tests for Machine-Learning Derived Phenotypes (abstract 115) 

- extension of [POP-GWAS](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01934-0) 

### Denitsa Vasileva: Improving Epigenetic Age Estimation by Combining Epigenetic Clocks (abstract 122) 

- clocks are fun
- of course different by training data set (young vs old)

## Poster Session 2 (10.05am - 11.25am)

## Session 6: Causal Inference (11.25am - 12.55pm)

### Phoebe Dickson: Exploring the Lifecourse Impact of Childhood Adiposity on the Human Plasma Proteome (abstract 47) 

### Xiaofeng Zhu: Multi-Ancestry Mendelian Randomization with Transfer Learning (abstract 146) 

### Apostolos Gkatzionis: Negative Controls and Selection Bias in MR (abstract 10) 

### See Hyun Park: Multi-Omics Analysis Identifies New Risk Loci for Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma (abstract 20)
