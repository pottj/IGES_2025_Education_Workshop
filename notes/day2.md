# Day 2 (01/09/2025)

## Opening Session

- slido questionaires
- IGES action plan for LLM and IGES

## Session 1: Williams Awards (9am - 10am)

### Yixin Zhang: Biological Group-Guided Mediation Analysis (abstract 97)

- BMI on HbA1c via metabolites
- Classic approach: test all metabolites
- Here: group metabolites to increase power & biological interpretation
- Framingham Heart Study data: BMI at exam 1, metabolites at exam 2, HbA1c at exam 3 to prevent inverse causation

### Alec McKinlay: Influence of Heritable Covariates on Genetic Studies of the Human Gut Microbiome (abstract 18) 

- ... and Consequences for downstream MR
- lack of replication of microbiome QTL & complex mechanisms of association
- example about lactose: if you are intolerant, because _LCT_ is not working, but continue to drink milk, your microbiome will start digesting lactose for you! environmental effect
- Flemish Gut Flora Project (FGFP)
- conclusion: do not do MR with microbiome as exposure (maybe as an outcome -> do always reverse MR) 

### Jakob Woerner: Polygenic Scores in Proteomic Risk Prediction (abstract 43) 

- UKB proteomics 2027 release for all participants & up to 5000 proteins (pharma release 2026)
- prevalent cases (before baseline), incident cases (after baseline), controls
- train set: prevalent + controls, test set: incident + controls
- in general: protein risk scores perform better than the simple polygenetic risk scores

### Fiona Pantrin: Characterisation of Diverse Global Ancestries Within Participants of the UK Biobank (abstract 58) 

- Most researcher focus on "White British" participants of the UKB - the rest is understudied
- get ancestry label for each individual
- try fine-scale ancestry group by IBD
- outlier: high IBD - Ashkenazi Jewish reference

## Session 2: Neel Awards (10.20am - 11:50am)

### Keynote Talk - Claudia Langenberg: Multiomics Insights into Diverse Human Diseases

- genetic architecture of plasma proteins
- start with some old example
- Sex differences in genetic regulation? --> mainly no, effect difference statistical significance, but not clinical relevance, only a handful of proteins with specific effects ([publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59034-4) --> check these few for causal effect of hormones?)
- Olink & UKB: scale up will be relevant for disease prediction & prognosis! Focus on trans, because that is what will increase with sample size, not cis (already saturated)
- find the pleiotropic common genes
- Genes & Health Study (>55k, David van Heel)
- Try to meet and talk about position in Berlin?

### Robin Hofmeister: Parent-of-Origin Effects on Complex Traits: Evidence from 265,000 Individuals (abstract 26)

- relevant for heterozygous cases, where it matters if the effect allele comes from mom or dad (dad wants to optimize survival of this baby, mom wants to optimize for future babies)
- assign relative parental side by chromosome X
- problem: siblings, solution leverage sex-specific recombination events
- UKB and Estonian Biobank
- 30 POEs, with different effect direction 

### Siru Wang: Heterogeneity Due to Ancestry and Environment Improves the Resolution of Multi-Ancestry Fine-Mapping (abstract 69) 

- MR-MEGA recap
- similar to talk she gave at the CM theme meeting a while back
- too long, I think no one controls the speakers time here...

### Hyunkyu Lee: covImpute: Leveraging Genetic Correlations to Impute Missing EHR Phenotypes (abstract 21) 

- check publication - cannot follow all those equations on the slide (not yet published, maybe some preprint in the next month?)
- new imputation software, better than the others (what all developers say...)

### Cathal Ormond: Bayesian Inference Model to Prioritise Rare Variants from Family-Based Whole Genome Sequencing Data (abstract 28) 

- BICEP: Bayesian Inference for Causality Evaluation in Pedigrees: pathogenicity + co-segregation
- too tired & hungry - hard to follow

## Session 3: Diverstiy (1:25pm - 2:55pm)

## Poster Session 1 (2:55pm - 4:15pm)

## Session 4: Statistical Modeling (4:15pm - 5:45pm)
